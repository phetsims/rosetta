Legacy Sim Translation Files
----------------------------

Some legacy sims (i.e. Java or Flash sims) had their translations manually added to the long-term storage repository
(https://github.com/phetsims/babel, as of this writing). These legacy string files have string keys and values, but
nothing else. Typically, a string file has string keys with a value, a timestamp, an array of previous entries, etc.
These legacy string files have caused some issues, and they are something maintainers should be aware of.

Here are some of the issues:
