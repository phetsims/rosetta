# Formik

Formik is the React form library I (Liam Mulhall) used to make the forms in the React code. It's kind of magical, and
I kind of hate it, but writing forms from scratch in React is a massive pain because it requires a lot of boilerplate
code.

Formik uses the spread operator `{...foo}` on React components to add fields to those components. There's a fair amount
of stuff going on under the hood with Formik, hence my comment about it being magical. I won't attempt to explain here.
