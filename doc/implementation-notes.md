Intro

This document provides an overview of the way the translation utility
works. The intended audience is developers who need to understand the
utility, and want to get some "big picture" information before jumping
into the code.

Overview
--------

Rosetta is PhET's tool for translating its HTML5 simulations. Its jobs
are as follows:

1. Gather data needed to translate sims.
2. Package data needed to translate sims.
3. Provide translators with a way to translate sims.

Rosetta accomplishes (1) and (2) using the backend/server. Rosetta
accomplishes (3) using the frontend/client.

### Backend/Server

The server uses Node, Express, and MongoDB. The server has five jobs. It
gathers and packages the data needed to translate sims, it makes the
data needed to translate sims available to the client, it serves
built/static files generated by the client, it stores translations, and
it requests builds for translations. Someone who is not familiar with
Rosetta might think Rosetta builds translations, but that's handled by
PhET's build server.

### Frontend/Client

The client uses React. The client has three jobs. It gets data needed to
translate sims from the server, it displays a user interface for
translating simulations using the data from the server, and it posts
saved or submitted translations to the server.

Vite is used to transpile and bundle the React code. The result of
transpiling and bundling the React code is a directory containing static
files. The server serves these static files.
