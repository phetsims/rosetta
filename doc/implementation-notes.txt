Implementation Notes for the PhET Translation Utility

The term 'project name' is used throughout the code as a means to reference a simulation or common code library.  This
is essentially the repository name, but the term 'repository name' was avoided in case another VCS system is adopted
at some point in the future.  Examples of project names are 'build-an-atom' and 'energy-skate-park-basics' and 'scenery'.

The utility relies on the node module "octonode" for commits to github via the github API. Rosetta does not write or read
from disk, it always interacts directly with files on github. Any commits to github are queued so that only one commit can
happen at a time.
