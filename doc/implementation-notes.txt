Implementation Notes for the PhET Translation Utility

The term 'project name' is used throughout the code as a means to reference a simulation or common code library.  This
is essentially the repository name, but the term 'repository name' was avoided in case another VCS system is adopted
at some point in the future.  Examples of project names are 'build-an-atom' and 'energy-skate-park-basics' and 'scenery'.
