# Overview

Rosetta is PhET's tool for translating its HTML5 simulations. Its jobs are as follows:

1. Gather data needed to translate sims.
2. Package data needed to translate sims.
3. Provide translators with a way to translate sims.

Rosetta accomplishes (1) and (2) using the backend/server. Rosetta accomplishes job (3) using the frontend/client.

## Backend/Server

The server uses NodeJS, ExpressJS, and MongoDB. The server has five jobs. It gathers and packages the data needed to
translate sims, it makes the data needed to translate sims available to the client, it serves static files generated by
the client, it stores translations, and it requests builds for translations. Someone who is not familiar with Rosetta
might think Rosetta builds translations, but that's handled by PhET's build server.

## Frontend/Client

The client uses ReactJS. The client has three jobs. It gets data needed to translate sims from the server, it displays a
user interface for translating simulations using the data from the server, and it posts saved or submitted translations
to the server.

Babel and webpack are used to compile and bundle the React code, respectively. The result of compiling and bundling the
React code is a directory containing static files. The server serves these static files.
