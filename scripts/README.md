# `scripts`

As of this writing (April 2022), Rosetta is still pretty minimalistic, and there are lots of things that come up that
can't be done through the Web interface.  In fact, at the moment, there really is no administration at all that can be
performed through the web interface.  As a result, scripts are occasionally written to perform a task that solves some
specific problem.  This directory contains those scripts.  The idea here is that this can be used, modified, copied and
adjusted, and so forth when specific tasks need to be done.

Don't expect a lot from these - they aren't written to solve every problem that might come up.  They are intended to
give developers a leg up in some situations.

If you'd like an example of a case where a script was created so that this isn't all so abstract, have a look at
https://github.com/phetsims/geometric-optics/issues/393.
