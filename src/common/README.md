# `common`

This directory contains modules used in both the frontend/client and the backend/server.

## Config Files

As of this writing, there are two config files in this directory:
`publicConfig.js` and `privateConfig.js`. `publicConfig.js` is a file built† from a subset of the "real" config, i.e.
the `~/.phet/rosetta-config.json`
file. The values contained in `publicConfig.js` are those needed by the client-side code, some of which are needed
more-or-less immediately upon starting the app. (Otherwise, we'd need to show a loading screen for a second or two.)
Some values in the object exported by the `privateConfig.js` are secrets we don't want to import in client-side
code. `privateConfig.js` just reads the `~/.phet/rosetta-config.json` file, parses the JSON, and exports the resultant
object.

† The `publicConfig.js` file is built using the `make-public-config-file.mjs`
script located in the `scripts` directory. This is the first thing that runs when we `npm start`.
