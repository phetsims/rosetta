## Naming Conventions for Test Files

For the time being, I (@muedli - Liam Mulhall) have decided to put "tests-"
before QUnit testing files. If you wanted to test getRosettaConfig.js, you
would make: `rosetta/test/test-getRosettaConfig.js`. The idea behind this
is to make it less confusing when searching for files.
